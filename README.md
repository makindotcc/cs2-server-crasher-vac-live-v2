## motivation

I want to have fun and play legit games with my friends, but it sometimes ends in hvl (cheat vs legit).

## explanation

someone forgot to update matchmaking.dll? idk, it tries to get packet struct field twice (0x20) and it ends up reading bad data in `CConnectionlessLanMgr::UnpackPacket`
